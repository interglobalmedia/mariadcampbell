Recently I upgraded to **Mojave** on my **Macbook Pro** (late 2015). I then decided it was also time to upgrade **Homebrew**.

Read more in my posts entitled [Upgrading PostgreSQL from version 10.4 to 11.1 via Homebrew (OSX)]() and [Changing your (Homebrew) PostgreSQL configuration from trust to md5]().
