As I had mentioned in my previous post [Upgrading PostgreSQL from version 10.4 to 11.1 via Homebrew (OSX)](https://www.mariadcampbell.com/upgrading-postgresql-via-homebrew/), I had one last step I had to take to ensure that my **PostgreSQL** upgrade ***configuration*** **mirrored** that of the ***previous version***. I had to ***change*** the following **configuration** that was implemented on version upgrade:

```shell
WARNING: enabling "trust" authentication for local connections
You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or
--auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb.
```

This means that ***any*** `postgres` **user**, root or otherwise, can login to **PostgreSQL** in the **Command Line** whether it be the ***system*** **Terminal** or ***integrated*** **Terminal** in a **code editor**, ***without*** providing a **password**. That is the **default behavior** when ***installing*** with **Homebrew**. I had changed it in the previous version so that all users had to login with their password.

Once you ***KNOW*** what you have to do, it really is not that complicated.

The following are the steps I had to take to change my **PostgreSQL** ***configuration*** from **trust** to **md5**:

First I had to go login to `postgres` via the **Command Line**:

```shell
psql
```

Then I typed the following command inside my `postgres` root user (`whoami`):

```shell
SHOW hba_file;
```

This command returned the following:

```shell
hba_file
-------------------------------------
 /usr/local/var/postgres/pg_hba.conf
(1 row)
```

This is the path to the `pg_hba.conf` file. This is the **PostgreSQL** ***configuration*** file.

Next I scrolled down toward the bottom of the file until I came across a **table** that ***contains a column*** called **Method**. It **contains** the ***trust*** **configuration**. I changed all instances of **trust** with **md5**.

```shell
CAUTION: Configuring the system for local "trust" authentication
# allows any local user to connect as any PostgreSQL user, including
# the database superuser.  If you do not trust all your local users,
# use another authentication method.
```

`md5` ensures that **users** have to provide their user ***passwords*** at `psql login` in ***any*** **Terminal** ***instance***. This adds another layer of security to your `postgres databases`, and mirrors login to the **pgAdmin GUI**.

Next I ***closed*** the `pg_hba.conf` file, ***quit*** all instances of **Terminal**, and then reloaded it.

Then I typed `psql` to login to `postgres` and was **prompted** to **enter** my **password**. I did, but it ***failed***! of course it failed, because when I created my root user, I ***never*** **entered** my **password**. I only created the database naming it with my username, so as far as **PostgreSQL** wass concerned, since it **did not know** of **any password** for this **user**, **authentication** ***failed***.

But I had ***already*** **removed** `superuser` **powers** from my `postgres` **user**, so the `postgres` **user** ***did not have*** the **authorization** to **alter** the **root user** in any way.

I ***had to go back*** **into** my `pg_hba.conf` file ***again*** and **temporarily replace** `md5` with `trust` so that I could re-login to **PostgreSQL** as root without a password, ***alter*** the `postgres` **user** to `superuser`, ***logout*** as root, and then ***login*** as `postgres` and ***alter*** the **root user** by ***adding*** a **password**:

```js
ALTER USER username PASSWORD 'password';
```

Then I logged out of `postgres` and even stopped it from running with the command

```shell
brew services stop postgresql
```

because **brew services** is my preferred way of **starting** and **stopping** the **PostgreSQL** ***server***. This is necessary in order for any changes made to be recognized at the next login. The same goes for **making changes** to the `pg_hba.conf` file. You have to make sure that `postgresql` is not running in order for the configuration changes to be recognized at the next `psql` ***login***.

Next I ***quit*** **Terminal** and then ***reloaded*** as before.

Then I tried to login again as the **root user** (`whoami`). This time I was prompted to provide my password, and everything worked as expected.

This taught me that maybe it would be good to have a `backup superuser` for cases like this, so I kept the `superuser` ***configuration*** for the `postgres` **user** for the time being. Its superuser powers, however, are NOT as extensive as the root user.
