To view the ***second edition*** of my **custom React workflow**, please visit the [react-workflow-updated-2018](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/react-workflow-updated-2018) repository on ***Github***.

I just finished updating the ***first iteration*** of my **React workflow** to reflect changes in **React 16.6** and **Webpack 4.3.0**. A lot has changed since last year when I put my last workflow together and documented it.

Now it’s a matter of updating that documentation. I am starting that today! What prompted me to start sooner than I expected was the following article shared on **Twitter** this morning:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">"Free software is suffering because coders don’t know how to write documentation" <a href="https://t.co/yIAMZolG30">https://t.co/yIAMZolG30</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/TheNextWeb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@thenextweb</a></p>

This is indeed a big problem, and the article is worth the read!

Below I share my original [React Workflow presentation/documentation](https://interglobalmedia.github.io/react-workflow-presentation/#/) from last year and my original [Evolution of Design And Development presentation/documentation](https://interglobalmedia.github.io/evolution-in-design-and-development/#0) from last year as well. When I had first added **CSS modules** ***functionality***, I had done so to an app created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md). This time, I add it to ***my own*** **React workflow** I use in a **React application** NOT created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
