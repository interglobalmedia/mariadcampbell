I’m cleaning house. More specifically, I am cleaning up my Github profile. But
I’m also cleaning up my house of code (in general). It was time to
`take out the old and bring in the new`. Today alone I think I **_got rid of_**
`46 repositories`. With a few exceptions, everything is still on my local
machine, but **_all my_** [Free Code Camp](freecodecamp.org) **algorithms** are
now **_housed here_** all with write ups and all.

I was itching to move on with my content. Now that I am enrolled in an evening
Full Stack JS Intensive boot camp at NYCDA while still searching for my next
developer gig or position, I decided it was time for a major overhaul. It felt
good to clean up. A tidy house of code means a tidy mind. I am a strong
proponent of that philosophy.

While searching for images befitting this post, I came across images of and from
a book entitled
[The Life Changing Magic Of Tidying Up](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308/ref=sr_1_1)
By **Marie Kondo**.

Apparently it’s a thing! Then I came across an image of a **_great quote_**
**from it**:

> Keep only those things that speak to your heart. Then take the plunge and
> discard all the rest. By doing this, your can reset your life and embark on a
> new lifestyle.

Things are looking good already.

**_Happy code clean up!_**
