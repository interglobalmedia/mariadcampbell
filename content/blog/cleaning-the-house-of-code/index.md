> Tidying isn't just a physical thing. It's an emotional thing. You face things around you, and you face your inner self - Marie Kondo

I’m cleaning house. More specifically, I am cleaning up my Github profile. But I’m also cleaning up my house of code (in general). It was time to `take out the old and bring in the new`.  Today alone I think I ***got rid of*** `46 repositories`. With a few exceptions, everything is still on my local machine, but ***all my*** [Free Code Camp](freecodecamp.org) **algorithms** are now ***housed here*** all with write ups and all.

I was itching to move on with my content. Now that I am enrolled in an evening Full Stack JS Intensive bootcamp at NYCDA while still searching for my next developer gig or position, I decided it was time for a major overhaul. It felt good to clean up. A tidy house of code means a tidy mind. I am a strong proponent of that philosophy.

While searching for images befitting this post, I came across images of and from a book entitled [The Life Changing Magic Of Tidying Up](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308/ref=sr_1_1) By **Marie Kondo**.

Apparently it’s a thing! Then I came across an image of a ***great quote*** **from it**:

> Keep only those things that speak to your heart. Then take the plunge and discard all the rest. By doing this, your can reset your life and embark on a new lifestyle.

Things are looking good already.

***Happy code clean up!***
