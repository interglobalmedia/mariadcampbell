Last week I created a little game with vanilla Javascript revolving around the `keypress` event that might end up being reused one day in a bigger project. There was a lot more going on under the hood than meets the eye, and I learned a new thing or two in the process. So I thought it was time to write another post!

I was inspired to create this game by a `keypress` workshop we did in my **Evening Fullstack JavaScript Intensive Course** I just began 4 weeks ago (yes, it’s already 4 weeks!). I wanted to take it to the next level. I firmly believe, and I am not at all unique, that it is important to push oneself to create, and more important, create new things applying what one has learned. It’s the only way to truly understand the subject matter, AND to make it stick. **Practice makes a better programmer** definitely applies. Sometimes I can’t think of what I should create next, so using our workshops as base inspirations definitely helps!

The `Javascript` **file** consists of 146 lines of code, a few of which are empty to break the code up, and much of which is CSS in JS. Then there is the `JavaScript` ***related to*** the `keypress` and `input` **validation**. There are ***two parts*** to the **game**.

The ***first part*** is to guess the keys you should press in order that a phrase from a song appears in a colored box with a dashed border above the text `Answer`. This can be achieved two ways. You can either press keys over the document (browser window) to make the colored box with phrases from songs appear, or you can type directly into the input field.

The ***second part*** consists of ***rendering*** `Your input is correct!` above the **text** `Answer`, and **replacing** `Answer` with `You guessed correctly. It is ...!` There are ***only*** a **certain number** of `song phrases`, and each corresponds to a ***certain*** `keypress`. Those `keypresses` are ***equivalent to*** a **string** that makes up a **name** or **word**. If you correctly type that sequence into the input field and press return, you will receive a message letting you know that you guessed correctly followed by the answer. In addition, ***after*** you **press** `return`, the `input field` is ***disabled***, and you can no longer type into it. You can keep on typing into the input with incorrect characters after inputting the correct string, but nothing happens. When you think you have the right answer, make sure to press the `return` **key**.

If you **type** the ***correct*** `keypress`es or ***sequence*** of `keypress`es to the ***document***, you will **render** the `song phrases` to the page. ***However***, when you **press** the `return` **key**, you will **receive** the ***error message*** `Wrong input. Try again!` in the ***colored*** **box**, and `Answer` will be ***replaced*** **with** the **error message** `You guessed incorrectly. Try again!`.

How I achieved this game via `JavaScript code` can be broken down into ***five*** **important highlights**.

+ Adding an `input.value` condition ***not equal*** to the **answer**.

+ Adding an `else statement/condition` ***not equal*** to the **answer**.

+ Adding an `input.value condition` ***not equal*** to the **answer** to the `input change` **event**.

+ Adding `input.disabled` ***equal to*** `true` to the `else statement` for `input.value condition` ***equal to*** **answer** in `input change` **event**.

+ Adding `page refresh code` to `click event` for **button**.

At first I ***didn’t add*** an `input value condition` to the `keypress listener`. So I had ***all these conditions*** for the k`eypress`es and then an `else statement` which **simply returned** the **error message** `Wrong input. Try again!`, but ***no condition against*** the **correct answer** which is **supposed to be typed into** the `input`. So I ***added*** **another** `else if condition` ***after*** the **first** `if` and subsequent `else if condition`s for the ***individual*** `keypress`es ***associated with*** the **songs** that ***checked against*** an `incorrect input value` which would ***result in*** the **error message** `Wrong input. Try again!` ***rendered to*** the **colored box**, and the **error message** `You guessed incorrectly. Try again!` that ***replaces*** the text `Answer`. This `else if statement` is then ***followed by*** the **final** `else statement` which ***returns*** the **confirmation messages** `Your input is correct!` and `You guessed correctly. It is ...!` I ***added*** a `disabled.true` **property** to the `input` ***if*** the **answer** is **correct** ***and*** the **user** `presses return` ***after*** `inputting` it. This is so that ***no*** `incorrect characters` can be ***rendered*** to the `colored box` ***after*** the **correct answer** has been `inputted` and the `return` **key** has been ***pressed***. Lastly, I had to ***add*** a way to **refresh** the ***page*** so that `disabled.true` is **erased** and the **user** can ***type*** in the `input field` ***again***.

I didn’t share code here on purpose because that would spoil the game for you! Please do check it out on Github, and give it a whirl! And let me know what you think!
