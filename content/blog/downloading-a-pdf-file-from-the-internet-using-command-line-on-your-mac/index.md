Since I have already written a [post](https://www.mariadcampbell.com/blog/compressing-and-uncompressing-directories-from-the-command-line/) about ***zipping*** and ***unzipping*** **directories** on a **Mac** using the **Command Line**, I thought I would take that track a step further by talking about how to **download** a **pdf** file from the ***internet*** using the `Command Line` on your **Mac**. I will also discuss where it ends up relative to where you are.

I will use a simple example that I actually learned from to demonstrate this. If there is a specific pdf file you want to download, please feel free to replace my web address and filename with yours.

The following  command in **Terminal** (`iTerm2`) will ***download*** the `pdf file` called `sample.pdf` from the `website` http://www.blazemonger.com/:

```shell
curl -O http://www.blazemonger.com/sample.pdf
```

the `-O` **option** consists of an `alphabetical capital O` and ***not*** a `zero`.

This `command` will ***download*** the **file** into the ***directory*** you are **currently** ***in***. So if you are on your `desktop` via `Command Line`, it will ***download*** the **file** ***there***. If you are in one of your **project** `root directories`, it will **download** it ***there***. If you are in a***subdirectory*** of one of your **project directories**, it will **download** it ***there***. So be aware of where you currently are on your computer! You can check this by **typing** the `pwd` **command** in your **Terminal** ***before*** you **execute** the `curl -O` **command**. This ***ensures*** that you are **already** in the ***directory*** where you want to **include** the ***pdf***!

***Happy pdf downloading!***
