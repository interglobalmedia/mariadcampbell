Recently I have been having major problems with VS Code on my Mac. First under High Sierra, and since this morning, Mojave.

I uninstalled the first time around using the application Clean My Mac X. Apparently the quick uninstall was not complete. I decided to see if there was something I missed the first time around.

When I upgraded to Mojave, my VS Code installation disappeared. I had uninstalled it and re-installed it, thinking that it was a clean uninstall. I uninstalled because VS Code had become corrupt, and I wanted to start over. But that installation didn’t seem to stick when I upgraded to Mojave. Couldn’t find it anywhere except in my home directory on my Mac.

I went into the application, and found that one of the tasks it does for you is uninstall applications. I went into the Uninstaller tab which housed all the applications I have installed on my computer, and found that Visual Studio Code was still completely installed on my computer. I had tried previously to uninstall manually via Command Line as well, but to no avail. So I tried to uninstall via Clean My Mac X selecting every single piece of my Visual Studio install. This time it was successful!

I usually don’t do this, but I highly recommend Clean My Mac X, “The ultimate cleaner for your Mac”. Without it, I would not have been able to get rid of Visual Studio Code. There seems to be no apparent way of actually being able to uninstall it like with most applications where they come with an uninstaller.

So far, my clean re-install SEEMS to be working . I will keep everyone posted if that changes!
