Earlier today I wrote a post about what happens when you migrate your data from an older macbook pro (mine was from late 2013) to a newer one (mine is from late 2016) with the **OSX Migration Assistant**.

In this post, I list the steps I took to uninstall **postgreSQL** installed from the **postgreSQL** [website](https://www.postgresql.org/about/) and reinstall it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

For those of you not familiar with it, **Homebrew** is `the missing package manager for macOS`. Created by developer **Max Howell** in ***2009***, **Homebrew** `installs the stuff you need that Apple didn't`.

I swear by it. So many other developers on `OSX` swear by it for so many different things. Today it saved me yet again.

These are the steps I took to ***uninstall*** my `postgreSQL` **install** from the `postgreSQL` **website**:

First I backed up my two postgreSQL installs, version 9.0.4 and version 10.3 to my external hard drive, JUST IN CASE.

+ I uninstalled postgreSQL with the postgreSQL uninstaller. Since I had inadvertently installed two versions of posgreSQL. version 9.0.4 and then version 10.3. I uninstalled both. The data directory remained after both uninstalls, so I manually removed both.

+ Then I had to make sure to remove all files and directories related to postreSQL before re-installing. So I checked to see if anything was left over by going into the following path in command line:

```shell
/usr/local/var/postgres
```

+ Then I did an ls -a to see if there was anything in there. There was, so I typed the following in command line:

```shell
rm -rf /usr/local/var/postgres
```

+ This removed everything within the postgres directory. Some take it a step further to remove all local traces of postgres (I did not because I had done an postgreSQL uninstall and then removed the data directory via GUI. I can’t vouch for this step since I did not do it.):

```shell
rm -rf .psql_history .psqlrc .psql.local .pgpass .psqlrc.local
```

+ Then I typed the following command to install postgreSQL with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install postgreSQL
```

In some places you may see `brew install postgres`. I went with the former.

+ Then, for the sake of ease and time saving, I started postgreSQL with Homebrew by typing the following command:

```shell
brew services start postgresql
```

+ If you restart PostgreSQL using Homebrew with this command, you will not have to restart Postgres services every time you want to run `psql`. It is a matter of preference.

+ Now comes the cool part. Instead of inheriting the default postgres db that comes with the GUI (Graphical User Interface) installation, you can create a customized one with your system username by typing the following command in Terminal/command line:

```shell
createdb `whoami`
```

exactly as shown, with back ticks and all.

+ `whoami` is actually a command you type in Terminal when you want to confirm what user you are in at any given time. By typing the above command, you are telling `postgres` to ***create*** your `default database` and ***name it*** with **your** ***username***. In my case, it is `mariacam`, so my default database is `mariacam` instead of `postgres`.

+ Next I typed the following command:

```shell
psql
```

And this is what was returned in the **Terminal** console:

```shell
psql (10.3)
Type “help” for help.
mariacam=#
```

+ The last step was to make sure that my projects were connecting with the database they were associated with and that my code was working. That part is up to you!
