Since I started my **Evening JS Intensive** **_bootcamp_**, I have found the
need to **_compress_** **assignment directories** for **_upload_** to
**Canvas**, an open-source learning management system (LMS) we use for managing
our course syllabus, content, assignments submissions, grading, etc. It became a
real pain to have to leave **Terminal** to get the `gzipping` done. So I decided
to learn how to do it **directly** from the `Command Line`. The problem with
some of my projects is that I have directories I do not want to include, such as
the `node_modules` **directory**. So this is what I did to exclude the
`node_modules` **directory**:

```shell
zip -r stripe-dropdown.zip stripe-dropdown/* -x "stripe-dropdown/node_modules/*"
```

This `command` **_means_** that we are **zipping** **_recursively_**
**everything** in the `stripe-dropdown` **directory**, **_including_**
**subdirectories** and **files**, but **_excluding_** the `node_modules`
**directory** and **_everything_** **inside** of it. We have to **add** the
**_full path_** to the `node_modules` **directory** in order to
**_successfully_** **ignore** it. `-r` stands for **recursively**, and the `*`
stands for **wildcard**, **meaning** **_everything_**. The `-x` **flag** means
`exclude`, followed by the `path` to the **directory** to **_exclude_**. I was
in the parent directory of stripe-dropdown when I executed this command, so the
path to node*modules in stripe-dropdown relative to its parent directory,
development, was `"stripe-dropddown/node_modules/*"`. On **OSX**, you have to
\*\*\_encapsulate**\* the **path** to the **directory** to **_ignore_** with
**quotes\*\*.

This is what was printed to the **Terminal** `console` as **_directories_** and
**_files_** were being **compressed**:

```shell
zip -r stripe-dropdown.zip stripe-dropdown/* -x "stripe-dropdown/node_modules/*"

Then, to **_unzip_** this **same directory** from `Command Line`, do the
following:

```shell
unzip stripe-dropdown
```

And this is what was **_printed_** to the **Terminal** `console` as
**directories** and **files** were **_extracted_** from the `.zip` and
**inflated/decompressed**:

```shell
unzip stripe-dropdown

```

Be sure to be in the same parent directory as the `.zip`. For example, I moved
mine onto the desktop so as no to confuse it with my original and complete
directory in `~/development`, then made sure that I changed into the desktop
directory, `cd ~/desktop`, and then executed the `unzip` command followed by the
name of the directory (`stripe-dropdown`) that had been zipped. No need for
adding the `.zip` extension. And that’s it! No more need to leave the
`Command Line` and go to your **Mac**’s **menu bar**, **_searching_** for
`compress stripe-dropdown` (or whatever the name of the directory you want to
compress is) **_under_** the `file tab`, and **_no more need_** to **leave**
`Command Line` to **double click** on a `.zip` to **_expand it_** into a
**directory**. It is a great time saver!

Happy `zipping` and `unzipping`!
