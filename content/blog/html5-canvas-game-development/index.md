I just finished developing a 2D Breakout Game using HTML5 Canvas. I added a
workflow to it of course for testing in command line purposes, for speeding up
the development process, and speeding up the process of making files production
ready. One thing I learned first and foremost: HTML5 Canvas games are
data-consumption expensive! By **_removing_** a **few things** from the
**_workflow_** like `normalize.css` and `postcss-mixins` **npm plugin**, as well
as `minifying code`, I was able to **_reduce_** the `JS heap` **_by over_**
`10mb`. **_However_**, the `range` still ended up being **_between_**
`16mb and 42mb`. Every time the **game** **_restarts_**, the `heap` is `cleared`
**_right beforehand_**. This is good of course, but the question is: does a user
want to consume up to 42mb of his/her mobile data? At home, via some kind of
paid internet service where total data consumption does not matter is one thing,
but mobile consumption can matter very much on the go when data caps do matter.

I did not decide to take on this project taking web performance into
consideration. I just wanted to become more familiar with game development and
drawing graphics with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And I did. It was a very
interesting learning experience, and one which made me even more familiar with
the JS Console and how to optimize the web performance of my project. To view
this project on `Githubâ€™s gh-pages`, please visit
