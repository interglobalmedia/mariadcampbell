I resisted switching to **_Microsoft‘s_** **Visual Studio Code** for quite a
while. Partly because I didn’t want to pay for yet another editor. I had already
paid for **Sublime Text** to upgrade to **V3** and get full benefits. I ended up
not liking it anyway! Then I had **WebStorm** which I got because I **_already
had_** **PHP Storm** and liked it for **WordPress development**. Paid for that
too. I **_mainly_** **ended up** **_working with_** the free code editor
**Atom**, however. I **_loved it_** because of its `UI` and `integration` with
`Git`. And the **Github team** **_created it_**, so that made it even more
appealing. I have been **_deploying_** virtually all my **Github repos** to
`gh-pages`, so using **Atom** just made sense to me.

But I found that **Atom** was **_becoming_** VERY SLOW. The bigger my projects
got, the slower it became. Then I also noticed that sometimes when I switched
branches, on switching, some files did not close. They would remain open and
unsaved when switching back to master. It got confusing and potentially
dangerous, because I would not know what was what. But this had never happened
before. Probably I had upgraded Atom, and the setting related to this issue had
gone away. That is another thing that I did not like about Atom. When one
upgraded to the latest version, certain, but not all, settings would revert to
default. I subsequently found out that there is a setting called
`Close File Deleted Tabs` in `Core Settings` that makes sure that **deleted
files** **_actually close_**. That helped. But in my case what was also
happening, was that certain changes didn’t seem to transfer over locally on a
`git merge` even though they showed up remotely! That’s because **Atom** was
becoming SO SLOW. SO I knew that at least for bigger projects, I would have to
start using something else.

**Webstorm** does not have the **_greatest_** **UI**. It also does not have the
greatest assortment of plugins. But, it is really great for remote deployment,
especially to hosting services. **_Connecting with_** **FTPs** is a **_snap_**
and things like that. So I will definitely continue to use it for specific
purposes. But I had to find something that would improve upon my daily
development code editor experience. In desperation, I decided to check out
**_Microsoft_**‘s **Visual Studio Code**. To my amazement, I found that the
editor itself is 100% FREE! I had been under the impression that I had to pay
for it. But that is not the case. So I immediately downloaded it and installed
it. I am writing this blog post with it right now.

**Visual Studio Code** is available now for **Mac**. I know that in the past it
was not. There is great documentation to get you started on a Mac. You can also
sign up for **Visual Studio Dev Essentials**. However, if you **_already
subscribe_** to a **Microsoft product**,** i.e., **Office 365\*\* (I do), all
you have to do is sign in with those credentials.

Have fun coding with **_Visual Studio Code_**!
