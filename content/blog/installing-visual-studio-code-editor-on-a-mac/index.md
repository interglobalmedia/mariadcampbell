I resisted switching to ***Microsoft‘s*** **Visual Studio Code** for quite a while. Partly because I didn’t want to pay for yet another editor. I had already paid for **Sublime Text** to upgrade to **V3** and get full benefits. I ended up not liking it anyway! Then I had **WebStorm** which I got because I ***already had*** **PHP Storm** and liked it for **WordPress development**. Paid for that too. I ***mainly*** **ended up** ***working with*** the free code editor **Atom**, however. I ***loved it*** because of its `UI` and `integration` with `Git`. And the **Github team** ***created it***, so that made it even more appealing. I have been ***deploying*** virtually all my **Github repos** to `gh-pages`, so using **Atom** just made sense to me.

But I found that **Atom** was ***becoming*** VERY SLOW. The bigger my projects got, the slower it became. Then I also noticed that sometimes when I switched branches, on switching, some files did not close. They would remain open and unsaved when switching back to master. It got confusing and potentially dangerous, because I would not know what was what. But this had never happened before. Probably I had upgraded Atom, and the setting related to this issue had gone away. That is another thing that I did not like about Atom. When one upgraded to the latest version, certain, but not all, settings would revert to default. I subsequently found out that there is a setting called `Close File Deleted Tabs` in `Core Settings` that makes sure that **deleted files** ***actually close***. That helped. But in my case what was also happening, was that certain changes didn’t seem to transfer over locally on a `git merge` even though they showed up remotely! That’s because **Atom** was becoming SO SLOW. SO I knew that at least for bigger projects, I would have to start using something else.

**Webstorm** does not have the ***greatest*** **UI**. It also does not have the greatest assortment of plugins. But, it is really great for remote deployment, especially to hosting services. ***Connecting with*** **FTPs** is a ***snap*** and things like that. So I will definitely continue to use it for specific purposes. But I had to find something that would improve upon my daily development code editor experience. In desperation, I decided to check out ***Microsoft***‘s **Visual Studio Code**. To my amazement, I found that the editor itself is 100% FREE! I had been under the impression that I had to pay for it. But that is not the case. So I immediately downloaded it and installed it. I am writing this blog post with it right now.

**Visual Studio Code** is available now for **Mac**. I know that in the past it was not. There is great documentation to get you started on a Mac. You can also sign up for **Visual Studio Dev Essentials**. However, if you ***already subscribe*** to a **Microsoft product**,** i.e., **Office 365** (I do), all you have to do is sign in with those credentials.
