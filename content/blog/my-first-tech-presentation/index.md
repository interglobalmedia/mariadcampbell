I’m giving my first technical presentation
[@ReactNYC](https://twitter.com/NYCReact)
[meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ReactNYC/events/242285478/) this Thursday,
September 28, 2017. 😅 And I’m using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) for my
slide presentation. The subject is **_“React Workflows without Create React
App”_**. I’m trying a fun and new approach which won’t be revealed until the
presentation itself, and people will be able to continue referring to it after
the presentation is over!

I’m sharing the stage with some really cool speakers (and topics):

Christian Cho and Rocky Meza of **_Everwise_**, **“Storybook: a Visual Testing
Environment for React”**

Andrew Joia, **“How to Conquer the Front-end with a React Component Library”**

Creating **_workflows_**, conducting **_tests_**, and using **_libraries_** are
integral to creating **React** **_web_** or **_native_** **applications**. I
think it will be a highly educational evening and loads of fun. **ReactNYC**
meetups always are. So come and join us! And wish me **_LUCK_**!
