**Update December 3, 2018:** There were some ***issues*** **along the way** ***due to*** **breaking changes** in **Babel 7** which ***affected*** **Jest**, **React**, and **ESLint**. ***Unless*** you are **using** ***create-react-app***, your **workflow** might have to be ***adjusted*** depending on what **support** you want to ***provide*** in any given **application**. I have brought ***all resources*** **together** in the ***repository*** for the **second edition** of my **custom React Workflow** on **Github**. Please visit [issues](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/react-workflow-updated-2018/issues/1) to learn more.

Some of you may know that I created a **custom workflow** last year ***without*** using **create-react-app**, but ***emulating*** its **core features**. I then gave a presentation at the **React NYC Meetup**. The organizers thought it too long, and I was not able to finish the presentation live, but that was OK! I had ***created*** the **presentation** with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/), and the ***complete*** **workflow documentation** was included there. To ***view*** the **first edition** of my **custom React workflow** (now a bit outdated), please visit the [React Workflow Presentation repository](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/react-workflow-presentation).

I became focused on deeper dives into **Javascript** (without **React**, don’t ask lol), **Nodejs**, and **back end**, so my focus ***turned away from*** **React** for a bit.

When I came back to ***update*** some **React apps** and other **JS related** things, I saw that ***much had changed***. And that’s when I decided to **update** the **first edition** of my **workflow** so I could catch up to what was happening in the **JavaScript** ***hemisphere***!

I just completed the workflow last night. As I write in my project associated with the repository,

> This is the second edition of a custom workflow I created for my React applications, incorporating changes that took place in React 16.6.3, ESLint 5.9.0, Babel 7, and Webpack 4. This is not meant as an all inclusive example of what has changed in those dependencies/devDependencies. Hopefully it will encourage others to take a deeper dive into them and expand their horizons as developers. I know that creating this deck expanded my horizons, and I had loads of fun learning new things along the way.

I also encourage those who decide to try out my workflow to let me know how it goes! I want to be able to improve upon my implementations and documentations going forward. And if you have any issues or questions, please create them in the issues section of the repository! Thanks!
