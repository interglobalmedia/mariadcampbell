**Update December 3, 2018:** There were some **_issues_** **along the way**
**_due to_** **breaking changes** in **Babel 7** which **_affected_** **Jest**,
**React**, and **ESLint**. **_Unless_** you are **using**
**_create-react-app_**, your **workflow** might have to be **_adjusted_**
depending on what **support** you want to **_provide_** in any given
**application**. I have brought **_all resources_** **together** in the
**_repository_** for the **second edition** of my **custom React Workflow** on
**Github**. Please visit
[issues](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/react-workflow-updated-2018/issues/1)
to learn more.

Some of you may know that I created a **custom workflow** last year
**_without_** using **create-react-app**, but **_emulating_** its **core
features**. I then gave a presentation at the **React NYC Meetup**. The
organizers thought it too long, and I was not able to finish the presentation
live, but that was OK! I had **_created_** the **presentation** with
[reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/), and the **_complete_** **workflow
documentation** was included there. To **_view_** the **first edition** of my
**custom React workflow** (now a bit outdated), please visit the
[React Workflow Presentation repository](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/react-workflow-presentation).

I became focused on deeper dives into **Javascript** (without **React**, don’t
ask lol), **Nodejs**, and **back end**, so my focus **_turned away from_**
**React** for a bit.

When I came back to **_update_** some **React apps** and other **JS related**
things, I saw that **_much had changed_**. And that’s when I decided to
**update** the **first edition** of my **workflow** so I could catch up to what
was happening in the **JavaScript** **_hemisphere_**!

I just completed the workflow last night. As I write in my project associated
with the repository,

> This is the second edition of a custom workflow I created for my React
> applications, incorporating changes that took place in React 16.6.3, ESLint
> 5.9.0, Babel 7, and Webpack 4. This is not meant as an all inclusive example
> of what has changed in those dependencies/devDependencies. Hopefully it will
> encourage others to take a deeper dive into them and expand their horizons as
> developers. I know that creating this deck expanded my horizons, and I had
> loads of fun learning new things along the way.

I also encourage those who decide to try out my workflow to let me know how it
goes! I want to be able to improve upon my implementations and documentations
going forward. And if you have any issues or questions, please create them in
the issues section of the repository! Thanks!
