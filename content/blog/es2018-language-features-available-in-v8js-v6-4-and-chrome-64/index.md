I just found out minutes ago on **Twitter** that

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Every single one of the new ES2018 language features is available by default in <a href="https://twitter.com/v8js?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@v8js</a> v6.4 and Chrome 64. <a href="https://t.co/Y0qdVSQHE7">https://t.co/Y0qdVSQHE7</a></p>

I ***just finished*** **downloading** `Google Chrome Version 64.0.3282.119 (Official Build) beta (64-bit)` and am typing this post using it. Can’t wait to test out `ES2018` features with it! And yes, it is **available** ***both for*** **Windows** AND **OSX**.

Happy ***ES2018***, ***v8js***, and ***Chrome 64ing***!
