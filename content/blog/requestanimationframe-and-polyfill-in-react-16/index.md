If you read my previous post, [My first time using React 16.0](), you know that I got the ***following warning*** when I typed npm run test in **Terminal**:

```shell
react-universal-blog-app@1.0.0 test /Users/mariacam/Development/react-universal-blog-app> jest

PASS&nbsp; src/sum.test.jsPASS&nbsp; src/App.test.js

● Console
console.error node_modules/fbjs/lib/warning.js:33

Warning: React depends on requestAnimationFrame. Make sure that you load a polyfill in older browsers. http://fb.me/react-polyfills

Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 totalTests: 2 passed, 2 totalSnapshots: 0 totalTime: 1.669sRan all test suites.
```

Notice something different?

```shell
console.error node_modules/fbjs/lib/warning.js:33  
Warning: React depends on requestAnimationFrame. 
Make sure that you load a polyfill in older browsers. http://fb.me/react-polyfills
```

The [React Polyfills](https://reactjs.org/docs/javascript-environment-requirements.html) link took me to the **gist** on **Github** entitled `React 16 JavaScript Environment.md`. There, I learned that **React 16** ***depends on*** the **collection types** `Map` and `Set`. And, that if developers

> are supporting older browsers and devices which may not yet provide these natively (e.g. IE < 11), (they should) consider including a global polyfill in (their) bundled application, such as [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [babel-polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill/).

Since their example used `core-js`, I decided to go that route.
Next, the ***warning*** in **Terminal** also let me know that **React** ***depends on*** `requestAnimationFrame`, even in `test environments`. And the **React Team**, specifically `@gaearon (Dan Abramov)`, states:

> React also depends on requestAnimationFrame (even in test environments). A simple shim for testing environments would be: `global.requestAnimationFrame = function(callback) {setTimeout(callback, 0);};`

So I first installed `core-js` using `npm`:

```shell
npm install core-js --save-dev
```

Then, in `index.js`, I added the following at the top:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import 'core-js/es6/map';
import 'core-js/es6/set';
import './images/favicon.ico';
```

And in `App.test.js`, right below my imports, I ***added***:

```js
global.requestAnimationFrame = function(callback) { 
    setTimeout(callback, 0);
};
```

Next, I installed `raf`:

```shell
npm install raf --save-dev
```

After that, I ***added*** the following in my `package.json` within my **Jest configuration**:

```jsx
"jest": {
    "setupFiles": [
      "raf/polyfill"
    ],
    "moduleNameMapper": {
      "\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|eot|otf|webp|svg|ttf|woff|woff2|mp4|webm|wav|mp3|m4a|aac|oga)$": "<rootDir>/__mocks__/fileMock.js",
      "\\.(css|less)$": "identity-obj-proxy"
    }
},
```

And lastly, I decided to install the `identity-obj-proxy` **npm package** so that I could `mock a proxy` for my **className** `lookups` in **Jest Snapshot Testing** because I use `CSS Modules`:

```shell
npm install identity-obj-proxy --save-dev
```

t comes [recommended](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/webpack.html).

Then I **typed** `npm run test` ***again*** to see what happens. This is what was ***returned*** in **Terminal**:

```shell
PASS  src/App.test.js PASS  src/sum.test.js
Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 totalTests: 2 passed, 2 totalSnapshots: 0 totalTime: 1.274s
```

Success! I added ***all the new features*** **required** for `React 16` (***so far***), and all my warnings and errors were gone.

I think the **React Team** is realizing that there are more and more developers either ***customizing*** `create-react-app` or ***developing*** their **own workflows**. Either way, I am grateful for all this awesome documentation. ***Thanks React***, **espcially** `@gaearon (Dan Abramov)`, who made this gist!
