As much as **Apple** has caused me big headaches with my new laptop purchase and
subsequent migration of data (and the saga isn’t over yet), using a program such
as **Pages** is a dream. What took me **_hours_** to produce via **Microsoft
Word** took me **_minutes_** with **Pages**. AND, any **links** I **_embedded_**
**actually worked** when I **_exported_** to **PDF**. With **Microsoft Word**,
the **links** **_no longer work_** on **exportation**! And creating layouts are
a breeze.

And why was this such a big deal? **_I can’t add a Microsoft Word doc into a
React application_**. **Only** **_PDF_**.

My `portfolio website` is **built** with **_React_**.

I didn’t want to lose link functionality in the process. At the same time, I had
to submit either a **Google Doc** or a **Microsoft Word Doc** in a **_resume
assignment_** for my **course**.

It would have been a **_nightmare_** to **create something pretty** with
**_either_**. I did it with **Word** because I came across a **_nice template_**
to work with. Then I had to **_recreate_** the **resume** via **_Pages_** and
**re-create** the **_layout_**.

**_Minutes_** to set up the layout. **_Minutes_** to copy the text from **Word**
into the **_Pages_** **doc**. Why doesn’t **_everyone_** **use** **_Pages_**
**instead of** `Word` or `Google Docs`? So much `design/web development`
**_friendlier_**.
