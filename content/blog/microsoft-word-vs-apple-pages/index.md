As much as **Apple** has caused me big headaches with my new laptop purchase and subsequent migration of data (and the saga isn’t over yet), using a program such as **Pages** is a dream. What took me ***hours*** to produce via **Microsoft Word** took me ***minutes*** with **Pages**. AND, any **links** I ***embedded*** **actually worked** when I ***exported*** to **PDF**. With **Microsoft Word**, the **links** ***no longer work*** on **exportation**! And creating layouts are a breeze.

And why was this such a big deal? ***I can’t add a Microsoft Word doc into a React application***. **Only** ***PDF***.

My `portfolio website` is **built** with ***React***.

I didn’t want to lose link functionality in the process. At the same time, I had to submit either a **Google Doc** or a **Microsoft Word Doc** in a ***resume assignment*** for my **course**.

It would have been a ***nightmare*** to **create something pretty** with ***either***. I did it with **Word** because I came across a ***nice template*** to work with. Then I had to ***recreate*** the **resume** via ***Pages*** and **re-create** the ***layout***.

***Minutes*** to set up the layout. ***Minutes*** to copy the text from **Word** into the ***Pages*** **doc**. Why doesn’t ***everyone*** **use** ***Pages*** **instead of** `Word` or `Google Docs`? So much `design/web development` ***friendlier***.
