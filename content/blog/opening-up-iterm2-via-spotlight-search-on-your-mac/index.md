For the longest time I **_couldn’t get_** an **instance** of my `iTerm2`
**Terminal** **_window_** to **open** via the **Spotlight** **_search bar_** on
my **Mac**. Then, today I was **_adding_** some `AppleScripts` and
`Shell Scripts` for **keyboard short cuts** I want to **_create_** on my
**laptop**, and I decided to **_try_** **opening** `iTerm2` **_again_** from
**Spotlight**. I had already created a short cut for opening a file or directory
in `iTerm2` when **_clicking on_** the **file** or **directory** in
**_Finder_**, but that still was too much work to just get `iTerm2` to
**_launch_**.

After a bit of finagling, I **_accidentally removed_** the `2` from `iTerm2` in
**_Spotlight_**, and the **application** **_showed up_**. So **type** the
**_following_** in the **Spotlight** **_search bar_** to make the actual
`iTerm2` **application** on your laptop **_appear_** in **Spotlight**:

```shell
iTerm
```

So when you want to **_open_** `iTerm2` in **Spotlight**, just **_type_**
`iTerm` and it will **appear** in the **Spotlight** **_search window_**. Some
things just aren’t as intuitive as we think they are!

Happy **_Spotlighting_**!

**Note:** If you **_already have_** the `iTerm2` **application** **_open_**, but
just **_don’t have_** an **instance** of it **_open_**, and **type** `iTerm` in
**_Spotlight_**, it will **immediately open** a **_new_** `iTerm2` **window**.
