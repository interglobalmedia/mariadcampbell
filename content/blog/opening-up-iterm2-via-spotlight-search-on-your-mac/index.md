For the longest time I ***couldn’t get*** an **instance** of my `iTerm2` **Terminal** ***window*** to **open** via the **Spotlight** ***search bar*** on my **Mac**. Then, today I was ***adding*** some `AppleScripts` and `Shell Scripts` for **keyboard short cuts** I want to ***create*** on my **laptop**, and I decided to ***try*** **opening** `iTerm2` ***again*** from **Spotlight**. I had already created a short cut for opening a file or directory in `iTerm2` when ***clicking on*** the **file** or **directory** in ***Finder***, but that still was too much work to just get `iTerm2` to ***launch***.

After a bit of finagling, I ***accidentally removed*** the `2` from `iTerm2` in ***Spotlight***, and the **application** ***showed up***. So **type** the ***following*** in the **Spotlight** ***search bar*** to make the actual `iTerm2` **application** on your laptop ***appear*** in **Spotlight**:

```shell
iTerm
```

So when you want to ***open*** `iTerm2` in **Spotlight**, just ***type*** `iTerm` and it will **appear** in the **Spotlight** ***search window***. Some things just aren’t as intuitive as we think they are!

Happy ***Spotlighting***!

**Note:** If you ***already have*** the `iTerm2` **application** ***open***, but just ***don’t have*** an **instance** of it ***open***, and **type** `iTerm` in ***Spotlight***, it will **immediately open** a ***new*** `iTerm2` **window**.
