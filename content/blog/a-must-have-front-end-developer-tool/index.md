Today I was adding a new project image to my front end developer portfolio, and
I had the damnedest time trying to match its size to all the others, which I had
created with the
[FireShot Screen Capture](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/take-webpage-screenshots/mcbpblocgmgfnpjjppndjkmgjaogfceg)
Chrome extension at another time. The trick to making all your screen captures
the same size is in the size of the browser window. But how was I going to
figure that out? I was getting sick and tired of redoing all screen captures
just because they weren’t all taken at the same time, with the probability that
the images would end up being different sizes. An experienced Front End
Developer knows that all images within a given element have to be the same size
in order for the layout to work.

I took it upon myself to find a tool that would provide me with browser window
size. I came up with just the right one in my Google search:

-   [How Big Is My Browser?](How Big Is My Browser?)

It does exactly what it says. It tells you how big your browser window is.
What’s even better, is that you can resize it if the size changes on you! No
more guessing games. No more re-dos. Nor more time wasting. Check it out!

_Happy Front End Developing_!
