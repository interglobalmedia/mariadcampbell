While I was **_delving deeper_** into `Command Line` tonight, I came across the
**_coolest_** `command`:

```shell
say
```

What does `say` do? The `say` **command** tells your computer what to “say” back
to you! So if you **_typed_**

```shell
say Hi there Maria how are you?
```

the computer would **_say_** the **sentence** back to you. It
[takes text as input and speaks it through its speakers](https://superuser.com/questions/223913/os-x-say-command-for-windows).
Is that cool or what?
