While I was ***delving deeper*** into `Command Line` tonight, I came across the ***coolest*** `command`:

```shell
say
```

What does `say` do? The `say` **command** tells your computer what to “say” back to you! So if you ***typed***

```shell
say Hi there Maria how are you?
```

the computer would ***say*** the **sentence** back to you. It [takes text as input and speaks it through its speakers](https://superuser.com/questions/223913/os-x-say-command-for-windows). Is that cool or what?

***Happy chatting up with your computer!***
