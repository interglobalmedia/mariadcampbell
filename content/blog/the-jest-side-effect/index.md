**Update December 3, 2018:** I found the solution to this issue and wrote an
article about it last night which I published this morning entitled
[The New Babel Config](/blog/the-new-babel-7-config/). I have brought all
resources together in the repository for the second edition of my **custom React
Workflow** on **Github**. Please visit
[issues](https://github.com/interglobalmedia/react-workflow-updated-2018/issues/1)
to learn more.

In my last post, I discussed the changes I had to make in my Jest configuration
so that Jest could mock out image imports in my React components. Then my Jest
tests would pass. I made the necessary adjustments following the suggestions
made in the Jest documentation (several approaches were provided), and my tests
did pass.

But there was a side effect to this modification. I no longer could use the
(proposed) class properties in my components even though I had taken them into
account in my Babel 7 configuration!

Indeed there was a bit of conflict amongst the playmates. I will be looking into
this matter further so I can make class properties work again. It’s nice to
reduce the number of lines of code in a component, even if by 2 or three lines.
Without class properties:

```js
class Text extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            listening: false
        }
    }
```

With class properties:

```js
class Text extends Component {
    state = {
            listening: false
        }
```

It just would be nice to get back what I had before just because!

**_The Jest side effect …_**.
